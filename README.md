# ESIP Machine Learning Cluster Tutorials  

This is the repository for ESIP Machine Learning cluster training tutorials developed under the support of Funding Friday from 2019 ESIP Summer Meeting. The tutorial development also received advice from Anne Wilson (Ronin Institute, ESIP Machine Learning Cluster) and Nancy Hoebelheinrich (Knowledge Motifs, ESIP Data Management Training Clearinghouse). If you have any questions or suggestions regarding the tutorials, please contact [Yuhan (Douglas) Rao](mailto:yuhan.rao@gmail.com) of [North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies](https://ncics.org/people/douglas-rao/).

## Instruction  

- To use R Notebook via Binder project, simply click on the _**launch binder**_ button on this page, you will be redirected to a virtual environment supported via [binder project](mybinder.org). You can then directly run/view the code in the virtual environment.  To use it locally, you will need to save a copy of the notebook to your local environment and install required R packages used in the notebook.  

- To use Jupyter notebook via Google Colaboratory, simply click on the notebook link. You will be redirected to a notebook in Google Colaboratory virtual environment. Please **save a copy** to your own google drive before running the code.
